# Convolutional Neural Network Cancer Detection #
Tyler Kinkade

The aim of this project was to identify metastatic cancer in a test set of 57,458 [histopathologic scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology) of lymph node sections based on a training set of 220,025 labeled, non-duplicate 96-by-96-pixel images from the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection Kaggle Playground Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection) (Cukierski, 2018). To achieve this aim, a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) was applied using the machine-learning software [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tyknkd/cnn-cancer-detection/blob/main/cnn-histopathologic-cancer-detection.ipynb) for the complete report.
